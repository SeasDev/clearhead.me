  //-Intro
  section.grid-row.grid-row-padding--full.grid-row-width--wide.intro
    p In a world where digital products can be iteratively changed and continuously optimized, it’s still commonplace for organizations to undertake disruptive full site or product redesign projects in shorter, specific time boxes. These projects are generally incredibly resource intensive and carry a high degree of risk and reward. 
    p While so much about digital consumer and business behavior has changed in the last 20 years, it seems that the redesign, as a project and practice, has survived significantly intact for many businesses. With investments this sizable, we wanted to gain clarity on the ecommerce website redesign process including the motivations for their undertaking, the extent to which data is injected into the process, how success is defined and measured and the problem patterns that frequently emerge. 
    p Clearhead, an award-winning digital optimization company, frequently partners with leading ecommerce brands to create better customer experiences through testing and personalization driven by data. With that in mind, we decided to go straight to the source. We connected with over 200 ecommerce leaders who have been through multiple resigns in their careers to better understand how redesigns are contemplated and executed today. 
    p We conducted both a survey and in-depth interviews, setting out to answer some key questions: 
    ol.key-quest
      li <p class="ol">1</p> How are redesigns typically defined?
      li <p class="ol">2</p> What are the best reasons to initiate a site redesign? 
      li <p class="ol">3</p> What is actually driving redesigns?
      li <p class="ol">4</p> How is data used in preparation for a redesign?
      li <p class="ol">5</p> What capabilities are most critical and lacking in executing a redesign?
      li <p class="ol">6</p> What was the confidence going into a redesign?
      li <p class="ol">7</p> What were the measures of success?
      li <p class="ol">8</p> What were the results of the redesign?
      li <p class="ol">9</p> Where do executives versus managers differ on these questions?

If you change 15 variables how do you know what caused the negative (or positive) impact.”

          p Many respondents we studied and talked to about their last redesign reported their sites had mobile experiences and UX issues that were so bad, they were confident that their judgement or best practices would lead them to a better site. They also agreed for their next redesign, they’ll need to test assumptions more stringently to get the next level of performance.

          p Further, the measurable success of the last redesign may be a function of vague expectations and qualitative goals rather than clearly defined goals and financial measurement. Only 34% said the reason for a redesign was to improve sales or profitability. And the number one actual reason for doing their last redesign was the site was “stale”.
          p Based on the research, interviews and our experience, we hypothesize the following factors will likely raise the bar for expectations of future redesigns:
          ul.purple-bars
            li Flattening of organic ecommerce growth
            li Increased competition (especially from Amazon)
            li Maturing of the mobile channel experience
            li Greater availability of precise performance data
            li Higher customer expectations due to the ubiquity of sophisticated UX
          p For the above reasons, we believe the redesigns of the future will feel different. What will or should the next wave look like?

            .question 
              p 1. More iterative redesign approach.
            .answer
              p A big-bang redesign creates risk and ambiguity. The risk is in making many decisions that go into one launch,  lowering the opportunity to validate each with customer feedback and data before launch. Second, performance ambiguity is created because it’s difficult to deconstruct what worked and what didn’t after an all-in-one launch. 
              p In contrast, we may see a broadening of the definition of “redesigns” in the future, evolving to include an increasingly popular iterative approach to validating priorities and UX decisions, testing, launching, and repeating that process for different parts of the site. This modern approach will allow each phase to have more confidence coming in and more data coming out on the impact.

            .answer
              p Hand-in-hand with an iterative redesign approach is an increasing capability to validate performance of UX decisions prior to launch. This can be done through wireframe testing (online or in person) or A/B testing a new UX. While we can look to UX “best practices” as a hypothesis to a customer problem, there will be increased appetite to test the impact of a best practice in a different business and customer context.

            .answer
              p With higher customer expectations, competition and slim margins, there is high pressure to drive profitable growth. At the same time, this is one of the biggest digital investments a company can make. We expect it to increasingly be asked "did it work?" and "was it worth it?" and for executives and participants to be required to answer clearly against the definition. We expect to see more definitions of success being tied to financial results. But moreover, we also expect to see the definition of success clarified and communicated more broadly as redesigns take an iterative approach and digital teams cross omnichannel boundaries.

              p As the success metrics of an increasing number of iterative redesigns get more defined, it will also be possible to get more detailed measures of performance improvement. In each phase, the performance of decisions and return on investments will be forecasted and targets set for improvements in conversion, average order value and other KPIs. As such, executives will be able to build more confidence in the results of their “change the business” activities.

              p If the last redesigns were largely about mobile UX improvements, we believe future redesigns will be made with personalization in mind. There is as much appetite as there is ambiguity around personalizing content and experiences for key customer segments based on referral source, prior purchases, customer value, preferences, and more. Defining the opportunities based on segments will be a key factor in UX and technology decisions in the next redesign. Further, organizations will take a more “service” based approach to features and experiences, leveraging APIs, data layers & algorithms more to drive the experiences versus features and widgets.

As a result, we will further optimize experiences and ability to accomplish tasks between devices. In other words, our focus will turn from simply creating a usable mobile experience to optimizing for mobile-first, mobile-dependent, and omni-channel interactions (ex: in store browsing, matching mobile web to app, increasing sign-ups and sign-ins, etc.).

            .question 
              p 8. Increased pressure for measurable improvements immediately at re-launch (as opposed to generous “bake in” periods).
            .answer
              p After a ‘change-the-business’ big-bang redesign a performance drop is often expected due to the user experience disruption. Iterative redesigns are essentially a merging of run-the-business versus. change-the-business work streams. As such, each phase of an iterative redesign will be expected to have immediate benefits, building up to an overall benefit of an iteratively-redesigned site.

              p 9. A desire to reduce the “cost to serve” websites, wherein many manual, time consuming site sections & activities will be called into question.
            .answer
              p Given the growth of digital teams over the past years, mature organizations will consider the effort to maintain a site as an important factor to their redesign decisions. There will be higher consideration of UX and designs that facilitate automated personalization and API-driven content.

          p As our survey revealed, site redesigns--from the reasons they begin to the end goals they serve to the very definition itself--are rapidly evolving. Many organizations have difficulty defining their goals and success, and many are gaining inspiration from past experience or the outside. 
          p Going forward, with the proliferation of technology, data and a more focused spotlight on UX, daring brands can engage ‘change the business’ redesigns with ‘run the business’ confidence. 
          p We hope this small peek into the world of your peers brings you a bit of confidence as you begin the journey toward your next redesign - whatever your definition of the word may be.
